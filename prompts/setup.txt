# Project Specification: Standard Normal Distribution Web Tool (v1)

## Overview

A client-side web application for teaching probability and statistics. Includes a standard normal distribution table, z-score highlighting, probability selection, reverse lookup, and a shaded normal curve visualization.

## Users

- Instructor (primary, lecture projection)
- Students (secondary, optional exploration)

## Core Features

### 1. Standard Normal Table
- Grid with row headers (z = x.0) and column headers (x.01 to x.09)
- Every probability cell is clickable
- Only one cell can be selected at a time
- On selection:
  - Highlight cell, row, and column
  - Show corresponding z-score in a readout
  - Option to save selected value to a list (stored in `localStorage`)

### 2. Saved Selections
- Store (z-score, probability) pairs in `localStorage`
- Display saved list in UI
- No export or delete needed in v1

### 3. Shaded Normal Curve
- Display a static or dynamically generated image of the normal curve
- Shade the left-tail area for the selected z-score
- Future versions will support right-tail and two-tail

### 4. Reverse Lookup
- Allow input of z-score
- Highlight corresponding cell in table
- Update shaded curve based on input

### 5. Z-Table Toggle
- Toggle between positive and negative z-tables
- Update table view and shading accordingly

## Data & Accuracy

- 4-decimal precision
- Use precomputed CSV table or math library (e.g., `math.js`)

## UI & UX

- Two-column layout:
  - Left: z-table
  - Right: curve + info
- Minimalist design
- Responsive on tablet and desktop (no mobile support in v1)

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: Vanilla JS or React
- Visualization: SVG, Canvas, or any easy-to-implement method
- Storage: `localStorage`
- Backend: None (client-side only)
- Hosting: GitHub Pages
- Access: Public

|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Z-table rendered         | 4-decimal values covering z âˆˆ [-3.4, 3.4]                         |
| Click to select          | One cell selectable; highlight row + column; show z-score         |
| Save selection           | Store in `localStorage`; show saved list                          |
| Curve shading            | Shade left-tail based on selected z                               |
| Reverse lookup           | Input z-score; highlight table cell; update shading               |
| Z-table toggle           | User can switch between positive and negative tables              |
